        <h1>10 Great Alternative "Lorem Ipsum" Filler Text Generators</h1>
        <p>By Jeff Gamet &euro;</p>
        <body>
            <p>Sometimes you need to see how a website design or page layout will look with text in place before you can decide whether or not it's going to work for you. But how, you ask, can we do that when the content hasn't been written yet? Lorem ipsum, my friend. It's traditionally Latin gibberish, but can be far more fun thanks to the list of awesome dummy text generators we found.</p>

        <h2>Flllerama</h2>
        <body>
            <p>Fry, Leela and Bender quotes make for great filler copy, so Fillerama is a great find. Even better: You can set the number of paragraphs for you copy, include headers, and even choose from other Ipsum styles like Arrested Development, Dexter, The Simpsons, and Monty Python.</p>
        <p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Large bet on myself in round one. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
